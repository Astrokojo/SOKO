THE SOKO FARM APP
Welcome to the Soko farm app, a well-established web application designed to swiftly deliver fresh agricultural products from farms directly to consumers. This project is divided into two main sections: the frontend and the backend, each aiming to provide users with a seamless and valuable experience.

OVERVIEW

Soko integrates a dynamic frontend, crafted with React and Tailwind CSS, alongside a sturdy backend developed using Flask and SQLAlchemy. This combination guarantees a responsive and interactive user interface, along with a secure and scalable server-side application.
FRONTEND

The frontend of the Soko app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. React is utilized for creating a responsive UI, while Tailwind CSS is employed to style the frontend components, ensuring a visually appealing layout and design. This interactive platform enables farmers and consumers to conduct their business transactions efficiently.

BACKEND

The backend is structured to complement the frontend with a broad array of functionalities, including user management. It employs Flask as the web framework, SQLAlchemy for database interactions, and Flask-Migrate for database migrations, among other technologies.
